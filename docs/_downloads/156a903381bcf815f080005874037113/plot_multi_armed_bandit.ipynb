Once we know the resistances\nof the microorganisms to the available antimicrobials we have to display which\nantimicrobials would be recommended. Without any patient related information, this\ncould be seen as \"advertising\" narrower spectrum antimicrobials while exploring\nhow these are being \"clicked\".\n\nB) Recommender Systems\n\nWe have our CBR system which measures similarities between patients. For example,\nby using an unsupervised (or self-supervised) approach with a neural network we\ncan compute the similarity metrics (e.g. demographics, clinical, biomarkers,\nradiology, ...). Anyways, based on these we have to retrieve from the database\ncases which are similar and show them to the clinicians. By using clinicians feedback\nwe could see which cases were being clicked and adapt the ones that are being retrieved?\n\nShouldn't we adapt the model?\n"
